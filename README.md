# Free And Open Source SEO Software
========

Pipulate expands your mind... and the way spreadsheets work by using functions
written and executed in Python entirely outside of the spreadsheet, cleanly
passing the values back and forth, replacing question marks for output. This
approach facilitates quick data-investigations from the comfortable of your own
spreadsheet&#151;effectively slapping an Ironman suit onto aspiring SEO or
Social Media professionals to give them superpowers. Watch the 
[Google Slides](http://goo.gl/v71kw8) and visit the sister-project,
[Levinux](http://levinux.com).

## Installation
Pipulate is made available ready-to-run on your desktop without an install.
Just download a copy of [Levinux](http://levinux.com), the Tiny Virtual Server
for Education, and select Option #4. It'll take awhile, but it'll build into a
Pipulate Server (minus scheduling, until you give it a gmail). I could
pre-build the server for you, but it's only one-time process, and I'd hate to
take away the opportunity for you to witness the process, perchance to poke
around and modify it yourself. And after you've had the Levinux experience, I
suggest you get it running on your own real hardware, from your main machine's
desktop to a Raspberry Pi.


### Mac OS X
From a Terminal:
- (Python 2.7 & Distribute usually already installed)
- lxml? Must check if Macs have that by default.
- sudo easy_install pip
- sudo pip install requests
- sudo pip install flask_wtf
- sudo pip install gspread
- sudo pip install lxml
- cd ~/Desktop (or wherever)
- git clone https://github.com/miklevin/pipulate.git
- cd pipulate
- python webpipulate.py
- Visit http://localhost:8888
